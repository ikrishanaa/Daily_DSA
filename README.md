## 📖 About This Repository

This repository serves as my **daily logbook** for solving Data Structures and Algorithms problems. Each commit represents one step closer to mastering competitive programming and acing technical interviews at top tech companies.

### 🎯 Mission Statement
> "Consistency beats intensity. Building a strong foundation through daily practice, one problem at a time."

### ✨ What Makes This Special
- 🔥 **Daily Consistency**: Solving problems every single day (green forest guarantee 🌲)
- 🤖 **Smart Automation**: GitHub Actions handle file organization and progress tracking
- 📊 **Progress Visualization**: Auto-generated reports and statistics
- 🧹 **Clean Structure**: Organized file naming and categorization
- 💡 **Learning Focus**: Not just solving, but understanding patterns and techniques

## 🎨 File Naming Convention

All solved problems follow a consistent naming pattern for easy tracking and reference:

```
XX_dayYYY_Problem_Name.cpp
```

**Where:**
- `XX` → Problem counter in sequence (01, 02, 03...)
- `dayYYY` → Day number of the journey (day001, day002...)  
- `Problem_Name` → Descriptive problem title with underscores

**Examples:**
- `01_day001_Two_Sum.cpp`
- `07_day003_Binary_Search_Tree_Validation.cpp`
- `15_day010_Longest_Palindromic_Substring.cpp`

> 🤖 **Auto-Magic**: Files are automatically renamed by GitHub Actions - just upload your `.cpp` solutions!
