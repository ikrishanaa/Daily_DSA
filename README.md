## ✨ About This Repository  

This repository tracks my **daily problem-solving journey in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
Each commit is a small step towards mastering problem-solving and building a solid foundation for **competitive programming & technical interviews**.  

- 🧑‍💻 Written in **C++**  
- 🔄 **Automatic file renaming** keeps everything neat (`XX_dayYYY_problem.cpp`)  
- 📈 Consistent **daily practice log**  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure  

File naming format:XX_dayYYY_Problem_Name.cpp


Where:  
- `XX` → File number in sequence  
- `dayYYY` → The practice day counter  
- `Problem_Name` → The actual problem title  

Example:07_day003_Two_Sum.cpp  


---

## 🚀 Goals  

- ✅ Strengthen **DSA fundamentals**  
- ✅ Solve problems from **LeetCode, GFG, Codeforces, and more**  
- ✅ Maintain **discipline with daily commits**  
- ✅ Build an **interview-ready problem archive**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Language:** C++  
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions + Python script (for auto-renaming & tracking)  
- **Editor:** VS Code / CLion
