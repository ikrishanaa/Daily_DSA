## 📌 About This Repo  
This repository contains my **daily practice solutions** to LeetCode and Striver’s DSA Sheet.  
I’m maintaining it to:  
- ✅ Build strong problem-solving skills  
- ✅ Track progress with automated streaks & progress updates  
- ✅ Share learnings through `NOTE.md` explanations  

All solutions are organized **by topic** (`arrays/`, `dp/`, `graphs/`…), with paired notes describing the approach, complexity, and mistakes.
